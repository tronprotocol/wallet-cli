# wallet-cli stake

Stake / delegate resources, and inspect staking state.

Staking lifecycle: `freeze ──► unfreeze ──(waiting period)──► withdraw`; `cancel-unfreeze` rolls all pending unstakes back to frozen; `delegate` / `undelegate` lend resource to others / take it back. `info` and `delegated` are the read-only queries to run before operating.
